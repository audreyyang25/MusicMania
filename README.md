# MusicMania
Our final project is a website centered around music history and fun music-related activities! To run/test our website, please read the following instructions:

Our html files are located in the templates folder. Our most basic website layout is in the "layout.html" file; the rest of the html files extend this layout. 

Next, we have our styles.css file, located in the static folder. This includes specific design tags and classes that make our website look nice. Also included in the static folder are the images that we use.

Finally, we have our app.py file, which defines the pathways to different pages of our website.

To launch our website, enter the musicMania folder and run "flask run". This should launch a webpage of our website. To navigate through our website, please click on the different navigation bar links -- the links will bring you to different pages of our website.
