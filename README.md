# MusicMania
Our final project is a website centered around music history and fun music-related activities! To run/test our website, please read the following instructions:


Our html files are located in the templates folder. Our most basic website layout is in the "layout.html" file; the rest of the html files extend this layout. For each page that you can go to, there is a designated html file.


Next, we have our styles.css file, located in the static folder. This includes specific design tags and classes that make our website look nice. The styles.css file is applied to all of the pages - all styling that is done throughout the website is located on this page. Also included in the static folder are audio files and an image that we use. Specifically, the background photo is located in this file. The other photos that are present in the website are directly  incorporated through their image addresses. The audio files are used in the games. Please make sure to download all of the files in the static folder since they are vital parts of the project.


Finally, we have our app.py file, which defines the pathways to different pages of our website. We have decided to use flask to help implement our website.


To launch our website, enter the musicMania folder and run "flask run". The output of “flask run” should be many words - the ones of interest form the web address. Clicking on this web address should launch our website. To navigate through our website, please click on the different navigation bar links -- the links will bring you to different pages of our website.


Here is a description of the different tabs on our website. When you first open the website, you will see the homepage. This is the home tab. Scroll down for a brief overview of classical music as well as the 4 main periods in classical music. Linked on each of the 4 main periods are pages about famous composers from those periods as well as links to articles to learn more about the periods themselves.


The second tab in the website is the quiz tab. When you click on the quiz tab, you will be brought to a page that shows two quizzes. Click on the quiz that you are interested in. Each quiz brings you to a quiz page that has multiple choice questions. Answer the questions using the buttons (you must click on the circles) and hit submit for your results.


The third tab in the website is the games tab. When you click on the games tab, you will be brought to a page that shows two games. Click on the game that you would like to play. For both games, you will listen to audio files and answer questions about what you heard. Write your answers in the text boxes underneath the questions with the specified format. Hit Submit when finished. Good luck!


The last tab in the website is the composers tab. When you click on the composers tab, you will see a grid of composers. Click on the composer that you are interested in and learn more! Each composer’s page has a brief bio along with 3 pieces by that composer.


We hope you enjoy our website!
