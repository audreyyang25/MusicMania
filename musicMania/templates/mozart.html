        <p class = "card1"> <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)</b>, born in Salzburg, Austria, was a prodigious and influential composer of the Classical era. A child prodigy, Mozart showed remarkable musical talent from an early age and composed his first works by the age of five. His father, Leopold Mozart, recognized and nurtured his son's abilities, taking him on tours across Europe to showcase his extraordinary talents. Mozart's contributions to music are immense, spanning opera, symphony, chamber music, and choral compositions. He played a crucial role in the development of the Classical style, infusing it with unprecedented emotional depth, intricate counterpoint, and structural innovation. Some of his most famous works include the operas "The Magic Flute" and "Don Giovanni," the "Jupiter" Symphony, the piano concertos, and the Requiem Mass in D minor, which he left unfinished at his death. Mozart's legacy endures as one of the greatest composers in Western classical music, admired for his prolific output, technical brilliance, and profound musical expression.</p>
